Project Run Instructions
Currently, our project is not live on the web (coming soon). For now, you
can run the application by downloading all of the source files and opening a 
CMD terminal in the folder containing "master.py". Please ensure that you have
the latest version of Python installed on your device before proceeding.
Run the following series of commands to install all of the proper libraries and 
run the app:
	>>pip install flask
	>>pip install flask-sqlalchemy
	>>pip install flask-bcrypt
	>>python master.py
Then, the app will be running actively on your localhost directory as delegated
by Flask, which is most likely 127.0.0.1:5000 (localhost:5000). The terminal
will notify you what page to enter in your browser to run the application.
Then, either type a new account into the text boxes to make an account or 
continue as a guest to view the application, and start the sorting quiz.
